hey all uh here's a very basic video on integrating chat chat GPD apis uh with no thread now there are already a few packages that have been uh developed by node Rad's open source community and uh they pretty much do everything uh like my favorite is this custom chat GPD uh node and it can generate images it can use the comp completion uh model um so yeah feel free to check this out but I still wanted to make a video explaining how you can use J activity in your project uh through apis or maybe build an application around chat GPD API uh build a custom node red node um so hopefully this helps uh let's get started so the so first of all these are few things that you'll need you'll need a chat GPT uh or open AI account uh so you can go to platform open.com and sign up there and then you'll need your API key so once sign up you can go to your username and then hit view API key and you'll create a new API key uh for uh for this account the next thing you'll need is a running instance of node red so I have node red running as a container on my Mac so this is uh where it's running local host 1880 so now let's uh set things up so I have a new flow let's call this ja GPT example now so we can follow along with the API reference here so what will be doing is basically making a request to the completion API and then uh giving it some contact and it'll generate a response based on our question that we asked now you can follow this uh same API reference to generate images audio files uh but in this uh tutorial we'll just be working with the basic completion API all right so coming back to no uh not rep I'm going to use an inject block let's call this question and here let's call this uh message do question and this needs to be a string we can update the string later next thing we'll use a function block to make our request so let's call this format payload and here we'll be using the payload that has been provided by um uh in the API references so let's call this message dot payload and this will be the Json object so this is the model that will be using uh Ro is user uh so temperature is basically how random do you want the response to be so if you put a temperature value of let's say 0.2 it'll be yeah it'll be more focused and deterministic so let's leave the temperature as 0.7 now for the content I want the message question to be the content that will be coming from our in check block so that's basically our payload now we'll use the HTTP request call Api now this is a post request and we are planning to hit the chat completion API so that's this now in header as specified in the the API specifications we need content type which is application Json and we also need an authorization token so authorization token is something you can fetch from uh your API keys so the header will be authorization and you need to add beer before the token so beer space and your token so this is my token so once this is done let's hit done now we just want to display this response in the debug panel so let's call it message or pay sort response all right so this is our very basic flow now let's ask a question let's say uh give me a tagline for a store that sells I know shoes and shirs sure so once this is in place let's ask the question and it's requesting API response so now once this is done and here the response so let's instead of let's get the response and ajon object so it'll be much easier to pass and look at so let's ask the same thing again so now if you look at the response if you go under choices and message so this is what chat GT gave us as a tagline for a store step up your style G from head to toe I mean that's pretty good now let's ask maybe another question um what is the theory of evolution now if I hit inject again it again request uh making a request to the coach GPD API and once it's done it'll generate a response right here so let's go back to choices and under messages the content and it gives us uh the theory of evolution as the content so this is uh pretty much how you use or start to use the chat GPT apis now for your not project you can add let's say a text input if you don't want to ask the question on the on the on the editor and you can also use something like a text output to generate a response on the Node red dashboard and add much more features or functionality around it so in the next tutorial I'll be uh building a custom node using this chat GPT API uh so feel free to check that out if you're interested and I hope this helped U thanks
